# Peter Rasmussen, Programming Assignment 1

This ```README``` serves as an informational entry point into the Python module pa1. **Please note
a more detailed, module-level ```README``` is available in the ```pa1/``` directory. The more
detailed README provides information about how to run the program, features of the modules, inputs
and outputs, an example output file, and licensing.**

## Lab Structure

* ```pa1/``` Python module selects the m nearest point pairs among a list of n randomly distributed
  points.
* ```analysis/``` PDF of pseudo code of the algorithms used by the ```pa1``` module plus analysis
  of runtime complexity and a comparison between the pseudo code and the implemented algorithms.
* ```resources/``` Provides default and test datasets; each input has its correspondingly-named
  output. Inputs and outputs are organized in ```resources/inputs/``` and ```resources/outputs/```, 
  respectively.
